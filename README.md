LC3Cpp

As fas as this goes, I pretend this to be my own implementation of the LC3 architecture Virtual Machine.
This project is mainly with educational purposes.
Hope acchive this project using [This reference](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/supplies/lc3-isa.pdf) of the ISA.
Everything works but the input system is broken by the way of how Microsoft Windows Works, from my side looks looks like a nice way to understand how computer works. Will be fixed some day in the future but I am open to pull requests :)
